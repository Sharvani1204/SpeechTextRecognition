# SpeechTextRecognition

This project demonstrates basic **Speech Recognition** and **Text-to-Speech** conversion in Python.  
It includes two scripts: one for converting text into speech and another for capturing voice input and converting it into text.  
A simple project to explore speech-based AI applications.
